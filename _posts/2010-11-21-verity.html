  Validations are important in many systems for maintaining data integrity with respect to some domain model.
  ActiveModel includes a set of validations which can be used in Rails for describing conditions on 
  model objects, but these are limited to persisted objects and lack expressiveness and reusability; slightly
  altering the nature of a validation often requires a new custom validation to be written. Verity provides
  a generic framework for validating any Ruby object, whether persisted or not, and composing validations
  with an expressive, readable DSL.

  <p>
    Validation is important for expressing domain constraints, ensuring that the data which is stored in an 
    information system makes sense. In a stock control system (for example) it would be nonsense for the 
    weight (or quantity) of a stock item to be negative. Validations allow us to prevent such data from being 
    persisted. Validations also allow us to check the sanity of the results of operations as a form of in 
    process error check. Any errors from these validations can be presented to the users, or put into a log, 
    in a readable form that explains exactly what went wrong and how to fix it. These improves the usability
    of the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good validation library makes it easy to express arbitrary aspects of the domain model. The complexity 
    of the code should be proportional to the complexity of the condition. A vital part of this is allowing 
    us to decompose complex conditions into small, reusable parts that may be glued back together in many 
    different ways.

    <a href="https://github.com/jgeldart/verity">Verity</a> is my attempt to provide an expressive validation system. Unlike <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/01/10/activemodel-make-any-ruby-object-feel-like-activerecord/">ActiveModel</a>, 
    the validations are expressed as a readable DSL. Unlike <a href="https://github.com/cainlevy/semantic-attributes">Semantic Attributes</a>, there is no tie to ActiveRecord.
