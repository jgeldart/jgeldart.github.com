    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
  Yesterday, I read an <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/whits/browse_thread/thread/3af4fe682836f2d3/88dcaf2ccd55df8e" title="Hypercode">essay</a> by 
  <a href="http://inamidst.com/" title="Inamidst">Sean B Palmer</a> on his thoughts (and criticisms) 
  regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>. 
  The main thrust of his criticism is that literate programming is, all too often, used in the style
  of a programming language tutorial. Rather than documenting the rationale behind the code, it
  instead documents the boilerplate. This is attributed to a fundamental mismatch between the syntax
  of natural language and the chaotic, woven nature of human thought.
  </p>
  <p>
  The joy of programming for many, as this article rightly states, is solving problems. The joy is
  not in the syntax, but rather it is in the conception. As with mathematics, a good problem is one
  which makes conception clearer, allowing us to understand and solve other problems.
  </p>
  <p property="dcterms:descripton">
  This article introduces an attempt to realise the vision of programming contained within that
  essay. By combining linked data, linked process and literate programming, I propose a more humane
  programming system comprising a development method and a new linked process language. This is only
  a first attempt at a solution to this problem, and no doubt my opinions will change as I explore 
  this space further, but I believe this captures my essential understanding of this fascinating 
  problem.

    <h2>A Brief Introduction to Linked Process</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
  <a href="http://linkedprocess.org/Home.html">Linked Process</a> is the behavioural equivalent of
  the, currently, more common idea of <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Data</a>. Linked data
  has begun to achieve a critical density on the Web with sites such as 
  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a>
  and <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/">Best Buy</a> exposing machine readable information embedded
  within their existing HTML pages. Linked Process hopes to capitalise on this by exposing programs
  as machine readable data over the Web. A linked process language would use the Web as its module 
  system, and allow for orchestration and adaptation of behaviour in a decentralised fashion.
  </p>
  <p>
  One of the first linked process languages was <a href="http://ripple.fortytwo.net/">Ripple</a>, a 
  concatenative language using RDF as its data model. This language adopted a stack-based operational 
  semantics, based on a stream of stacks model that was both familiar and powerful. The stream model 
  allowed the language to exploit the non-determinism inherent in an open system like the Web. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Ripple, however, was not the first language to attempt to provide an RDF expressed ‘bytecode’. The
  <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/haystack/">Haystack project</a> developed an a language called 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine_(programming_language)">Adenine</a>, with a loosely
  <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> based syntax, for expressing operations on their 
  RDF-based internal data-model. The representation was, however, purely syntactic and did not
  leverage either the semantics of RDF or the conceptual semantics of the developers.
  </p>
  <p>
  A couple of years ago, I wrote a <a href="http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/19/5/791" title="Category-based Equational Reasoning: An Approach to Ontology">paper</a>
  exploring the possibility of expressing the semantics of RDF using 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_Theory">category theory</a>. This was motivated by 
  Ripple, the <a href="http://www.cat-language.com/">Cat programming language</a> and my
  research into <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/narswang/" title="Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System">higher-order uncertain logics</a>. 
  Since that paper, I have been fascinated by the possibilities of linking research into web 
  science with general research into category theory and, in particular, 
  <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/projs/inst.html">institution theory</a>. This is an area 
  with a lot of potential, particularly if we can connect 
  <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/">Joseph Goguen</a>’s work on 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/pps/taspm.pdf">cognitive blends in terms of institutions</a> to the
  idea of <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2008/papers/20-idehen-erling-linked-data-spaces.pdf">linked data spaces</a> and named graphs.
  </p>
  <p>
  The remainder of this article looks at the potential for combining these ideas with those of
  literate programming to produce documents which are both human-readable specifications and
  testable realisations of those specifications. 
  </p>
</section>
<section id="sec-executable-specifications">
  <header>
    <h2>Executable Specifications</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
  A specification is, essentially, a description of the problem to be solved. Specifications
  can include many sorts of constraint. Some are purely functional, containing elaborate
  detail on the executable behaviour of a solution. Others are purely non-functional, and
  simply describe the motivations behind the desire for a solution to the problem. Most
  specifications are somewhere in the middle, combining some executable behaviour with 
  business cases.
  </p>
  <p>
  Recently, <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">Behaviour Driven Development</a> (BDD) has sought 
  to formalise this balancing act. A specification is seen as a set of <em>features</em>. Each
  feature consists of a business case, usually expressed as a user story, coupled with a set
  of <em>scenarios</em> which turn that story into a testable narrative. There are a number
  of popular BDD frameworks such as <a href="http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber">Cucumber</a>,
  <a href="http://jbehave.org/">JBehave</a> and <a href="http://visionmedia.github.com/jspec/">jspec</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  These tools have a weakness, however, in that the implementation of the specification is
  utterly distinct from its description. Acceptance test tools like <a href="http://fitnesse.org/">Fitnesse</a> 
  attempt to solve this by providing a user interface that can link tests to source code files. This is
  crude; you cannot see how a particular part of the specification is realised by a particular part of
  the implementation. This reduces traceability of requirements, and requires that the specification,
  including tests, be manually kept up-to-date with the implementation. In my experience in development,
  writing code frequently alters the understanding of the problem itself; in fact, that is the most
  enjoyable part of the process. These changes of understanding need to be manually percolated through
  to the specification. This is error-prone, but necessary if the client is to be kept in the loop
  on the development process.
  </p>
  <p>
  On the Web, we navigate through a mind-boggling complex sea of information by looking at small
  fragments at a time. These fragments, which we call pages, are connected together by hyperlinks
  which can be navigated by a user, in their own time, to create a custom narrative exploration
  of the available information. These links also express relational information, a fact exploited
  by search engines such as Google, which may be used to tie together the meaning of the documents.
  This is the key insight of linked data.
  </p>
  <p>
  I propose viewing specifications as linked data and linked process combined. A specification is
  then not only a description of a system in a human readable form, but also its realisation. When
  necessary they can be viewed together, or separately, depending on what is needed. They exist on
  the Web and can, therefore, exploit all the features and benefits of the Web architecture such as
  decentralisation, openness and partiality of description. Since the specification and the 
  implementation are fundamentally linked, changes to the specification may automatically change
  the implementation, and vice versa. The specification is automatically and fundamentally in 
  sync with the implementation at all times, and thus serves as accurate documentation of a
  project.
  </p>
  <p>
  Whilst many representations of a program are possible, probably the best (for this purpose) is
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a> embedded in HTML. The HTML provides the 
  specification whilst the RDFa annotates this specification with an implementation. As an
  example, consider the following definition of a Fibonacci number.
  </p>
  <figure class="specification">
    <blockquote>
    <h3>Fibonacci Numbers</h3>
    <p>
    Given a natural number n, the n<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number is defined as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The 0<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number is 0;</li>
      <li>The 1<sup>st</sup> Fibonacci number is 1; and</li>
      <li>If n >= 2, the n<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number is the sum of the n-1<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci
          number, and the n-2<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number.</li>
    </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>A specification for Fibonacci numbers.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
  To begin turning this specification into a linked process, we must first give it a URI by adding an
  <code>about</code> attribute. We may then add some basic metadata, such as the sort of executable
  unit being described by the specification (in this case it is a pure predicate) and the parameters
  it takes:
  </p>
  <figure class="code">
    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>  &lt;figure class="specification" typeof="prog:PurePredicate" id="fib" about="#fib" prefix="prog: http://www.example.com/hypercode/core.html#"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 property="dc:title"&gt;Fibonacci Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span rel="prog:arg"&gt;&lt;span about="#fib-n" id="fib-n" typeof="prog:Argument"&gt;Given a 
  &lt;a rel="rdf:type" href="http://www.example.com/hypercode/core-types.html#Natural"&gt;natural number&lt;/a&gt; n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, 
&lt;span rel="prog:outputArg"&gt;&lt;span about="#fib-out" id="fib-out" typeof="prog:OutputArgument"&gt;the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Fibonacci number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
is defined as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;
...
      </code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>Basic metadata for an executable unit.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
  Of note in the above is the use of existing vocabularies, such as 
  <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>. One can freely annotate the specification with 
  any desired vocabularies. For example, each executable unit could be annotated with its own
  licence in a machine readable fashion, or with its creator or with topics drawn from a thesaurus.
  The only limit here is one’s imagination.
  </p>
  <p>
  Also worth noting is the use of two different sorts of argument; plain arguments and output 
  arguments. One of the ideas behind this programming language is that predicates may be used in 
  both a <em>logical</em> and a <em>functional</em> fashion. If an argument is an output argument,
  and there may be at most one of these for an executable unit, then the result of this, when used
  functionally, is the value of the expression.
  </p>
  <p>
  The body of the specification consists of a number of cases describing the behaviour of this
  executable unit depending on a set of conditionals. Let us annotate the specification to 
  implement the first two cases:
  </p>
  <figure class="code">
    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li rel="prog:case"&gt;
&lt;div typeof="prog:Case"&gt;
The &lt;span rel="prog:condition"&gt;
    &lt;span typeof="prog:equals"&gt;
      &lt;span rel="prog:arg" resource="#fib-n"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span property="prog:arg"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Fibonacci number
    &lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span rel="prog:body"&gt;
&lt;span typeof="prog:equals"&gt;
  &lt;span rel="prog:arg" resource="#fib-out"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;a rel="rdf:type" href="http://www.example.com/hypercode/core.html#equals"&gt;is&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;span property="prog:arg"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li rel="prog:case"&gt;
&lt;div typeof="prog:Case"&gt;
The &lt;span rel="prog:condition"&gt;
    &lt;span typeof="prog:equals"&gt;
      &lt;span rel="prog:arg" resource="#fib-n"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span property="prog:arg"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Fibonacci number
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span rel="prog:body"&gt;
    &lt;span typeof="prog:equals"&gt;
      &lt;span rel="prog:arg" resource="#fib-out"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;a rel="rdf:type" href="http://www.example.com/hypercode/core.html#equals"&gt;is&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;span property="prog:arg"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;; and
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
...
      </code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>The first two cases in the Fibonacci specification.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
  Each case has a set of conditions; if <em>any</em> of these conditions are satisfied then the 
  case may execute. Execution procedes by finding a coherent ordering of <em>all</em> of the bodies.
  In this case, with only a single body, this is trivial.
  </p>
  <p>
  Calls of executable units are encoded using classes; each executable unit is effectively the class
  of its executions. This allows execution traces to be represented as linked data, and thus we
  can bring to bear all the same tools.
  </p>
  <p>
  It should be noted that, where possible, normal HTML hyperlinks are used to connect (for example)
  arguments with their definitions, and executable units with their specifications. This allows for
  normal hypertext usage, as discussed earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
  Turning to the third case, we shall see an example of functional calling easing the specification:
  </p>
  <figure class="code">
    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>  &lt;li rel="prog:case"&gt;
&lt;div typeof="prog:Case"&gt; 
&lt;span rel="prog:condition"&gt;
If
&lt;span typeof="prog:Predicate"&gt;
  &lt;a rel="prog:arg" href="#fib-n"&gt;n&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;a rel="rdf:type" href="http://www.example.com/hypercode/core.html#gte"&gt;is greater than or equal to&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;span property="prog:arg"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span rel="prog:body"&gt; 
then
&lt;span typeof="prog:Predicate"&gt;
  &lt;a rel="prog:arg" href="#fib-out"&gt;the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Fibonacci number&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;a rel="rdf:type" href="http://www.example.com/hypercode/core.html#equals"&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;span rel="prog:arg"&gt;the 
    &lt;a rel="rdf:type" href="http://www.example.com/hypercode/core.html#add"&gt;sum&lt;/a&gt; of 
    &lt;span rel="prog:arg"&gt;the 
      &lt;span rel="#fib-n"&gt;
        &lt;a rel="prog:subtractand" href="#fib-n"&gt;n&lt;/a&gt; 
        &lt;a rel="rdf:type" href="http://www.example.com/hypercode/core.html#subtract"&gt;-&lt;/a&gt; 
        &lt;span property="prog:subtractor"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;th 
      &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;a rel="rdf:type" href="#fib"&gt;Fibonacci number&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt; and 
    &lt;span rel="prog:arg"&gt;the 
      &lt;span rel="#fib-n"&gt;
        &lt;a rel="prog:subtractand" href="#fib-n"&gt;n&lt;/a&gt; 
        &lt;a rel="rdf:type" href="http://www.example.com/hypercode/core.html#subtract"&gt;-&lt;/a&gt; 
        &lt;span property="prog:subtractor"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;th 
      &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;a rel="rdf:type" href="#fib"&gt;Fibonacci number&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;.
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
      </code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>The third case in the Fibonacci specification.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
  Other than its greater complexity, there is little new in this case apart from the use of
  a functional calling style. This allows the implementation to adhere to the structure of
  the specification more closely. I anticipate that in real specifications, a mixture of
  a relational style and a functional style would be used to match the way the specification 
  was written.
  </p>
  <p>
  I will finish this section by providing the fully annotated specification. If you look 
  at the source code for this page, or run it through an <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/shadowextract?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fjgeldart.github.com%2Fessays%2Fhypercode-linked-process.html&format=turtle">RDFa extractor</a>, you will find 
  the executable definition.

  <p>
  Of course, we are not limited to just HTML. We could annotate equations written in MathML, for
  example, or a state-machine diagram in SVG. Rather than translating whatever is the best notation
  for our problem into some programming language in a separate file, we simply add enough information
  to our specification to make it run. I believe this will eliminate a lot of the disconnect between
  conception and realisation, and reduce the number of bugs resulting from the mental conversion of
  concepts.

    <h2>Tooling</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
  Whilst I feel this way of writing programs as linked data annotations on specifications has a certain
  elegance, I believe this idea will really shine with good tool support. IDEs have become a common way
  to navigate code, but with this your browser can be your IDE working on your specification.
  </p>
  <p>
  Imagine taking the above specification, before the annotations were added, and selecting the whole
  block. With a single command, the block becomes an executable unit, perhaps automatically setting
  the <code>dc:title</code> property on the heading. Select the text ‘Fibonacci number’ in the third
  case and another command could search through all linked processes to find those which look similar,
  in this case the very predicate we're defining. We can use the browser to incrementally mark-up our
  specification with behaviour.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      ... since the behaviour is described using linked data, this is trivial.
    </blockquote>
  </aside>
  <p>
  Should we want a different view, say as a <a href="http://www.subtextual.org/">schematic table</a>, then since the behaviour is described in 
  linked data, this is trivial. In fact, people could write web applications that simply provide a 
  different visualisation on the executable units in different web pages. Programs become data for
  mash-ups. An entrepreneurial developer could produce a service that turns a program into an 
  execution diagram, or a dependency diagram, or anything for which there is a need.

  With the wealth of data that is exposed by providing executable specifications in the form of
  linked data, search engines can be used to find routines others have written and published. Using
  them in your code is as simple as using their URI. If the routines are annotated with licencing
  information, then an IDE would be able to automatically work out whether or not there is a
  conflict. Search engines could also filter their results by compatible licences.

  I believe that there are many opportunities afforded by this method, and by having the structure
  of the code available explicitly rather than serialised into a linear form. Rich comments can
  be defined, shown, hidden, linked and thrown away without touching the code itself. A web
  application could host collaborative comments for a team, without needing to touch the code just
  by using linked data principles. I am sure there are many more ideas that I haven’t thought of 
  just waiting for someone out there to develop them.

  By making specifications executable, we can allow for live specifications. By embedding a
  Javascript interpreter in the page, we could run our implementation, test it and also test the 
  assumptions in the requirements. This allows for a much tighter feedback cycle than current 
  tools. By providing a link to the specification to a client, we can push that through to the 
  full development cycle, allowing our customers to see how the specification works just by
  playing with it.
  </p>
  <p>
  Test suites can be added to the specification as annotations, and previous executions (remember,
  they're instances of the specification) can be trivially turned into tests. Through the 
  same distributed extensibility mechanisms as I have already mentioned, others can easily extend
  the testing mechanisms. Want to add something like <a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/">QuickCheck</a>? No problem. Just define the 
  propositions in RDF and write a web application, or a piece of Javascript, to test them. At any 
  point, one may navigate through an execution trace as if it were a piece of the Web, because it is.
  </p>
  <p>
  We could also use this method to allow for linked process web-services over simple HTTP. A suitable
  server extension could react to <code>POST</code> requests on the document by running the
  appropriate code. Clients could find new services simply by using a semantic web search engine.
  A <code>GET</code> request on the document would yield a precise description of its parameters 
  and behaviour, which could be used in the matchmaking and orchestration process.

  At the time of writing, this idea is less than 24 hours old so there is plenty of work to do. I need
  to define a vocabulary for expressing the executable behaviours. I need to define a formal semantics
  for the execution model. I need to write a Javascript interpreter and maybe a command-line one too.
  There needs to be a good IDE.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please bear with me as I explore these thoughts further. I was excited to feel so many pieces of 
  what I have worked on over the past ten years come together so nicely so I would like to thank 
  Sean for his provocative essay. If you are interested in the ideas here, please <a href="http://www.joegeldart.com/">contact me</a>.
