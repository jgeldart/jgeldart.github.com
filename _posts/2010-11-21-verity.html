  Validations are important in many systems for maintaining data integrity with respect to some domain model.
  ActiveModel includes a set of validations which can be used in Rails for describing conditions on 
  model objects, but these are limited to persisted objects and lack expressiveness and reusability; slightly
  altering the nature of a validation often requires a new custom validation to be written. Verity provides
  a generic framework for validating any Ruby object, whether persisted or not, and composing validations
  with an expressive, readable DSL.

    <h2>Why do we validate?</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Validation is important for expressing domain constraints, ensuring that the data which is stored in an 
    information system makes sense. In a stock control system (for example) it would be nonsense for the 
    weight (or quantity) of a stock item to be negative. Validations allow us to prevent such data from being 
    persisted. Validations also allow us to check the sanity of the results of operations as a form of in 
    process error check. Any errors from these validations can be presented to the users, or put into a log, 
    in a readable form that explains exactly what went wrong and how to fix it. These improves the usability
    of the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good validation library makes it easy to express arbitrary aspects of the domain model. The complexity 
    of the code should be proportional to the complexity of the condition. A vital part of this is allowing 
    us to decompose complex conditions into small, reusable parts that may be glued back together in many 
    different ways.

    <a href="https://github.com/jgeldart/verity">Verity</a> is my attempt to provide an expressive validation system. Unlike <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/01/10/activemodel-make-any-ruby-object-feel-like-activerecord/">ActiveModel</a>, 
    the validations are expressed as a readable DSL. Unlike <a href="https://github.com/cainlevy/semantic-attributes">Semantic Attributes</a>, there is no tie to ActiveRecord.

    <h2>A humane validation library</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Verityâ€™s aim is to make validations readable and composable and, therefore, more maintainable. After spending too 
    long writing complex, interdependent validations for a project with an (admittedly) tricky data model, I decided 
    that enough was enough. Validations are a vital part of the definition of a data model in any real-world 
    application, where data noise can be introduced by its users and code and must be prevented. As such, they should 
    be as nice to define as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Verity accomplishes this in two main ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It provides a DSL for defining the validations in a readable syntax similar to RSpec; and</li>
    <li>It treats validations lazily, so that they can be composed to construct more complex validations out of simpler ones.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The main inspirations for the project are <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> and <a href="http://github.com/cainlevy/semantic-attributes/">Semantic Attributes</a>, 
    a similar attempt to define a DSL for validations (although without the composability).
  </p>
  <p>
    As additional goals, Verity aims to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Be agnostic as to what persistence framework, if any, is being used; it is as useful on plain Ruby objects as it is on ActiveRecord records;</li>
    <li>Be easy to extend, with new predicates that can be shared with other developers and projects; and</li>
    <li>Integrate well with whatever internationalisation framework is being used to support multi-lingual and multi-region applications.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Possible future goals include integration with YARD, for easy documentation of model constraints, and RSpec and Cucumber, for testing these constraints.

    <h2>Using Verity</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Enabling Verity's DSL and core API on an object is simply a matter of using the
    class method <code>verifiable</code> in the class definition. This is an extension added
    to <code>Object</code> when the gem is loaded:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  verifiable
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Instances of this class now have a number of methods defined upon them for
    performing validations. <code>#valid?</code> returns <code>false</code> if and only if the
    instance fails to satisfy the defined conditions and <code>true</code> otherwise (note
    that it will return <code>true</code> if no validations are defined at all).
    <code>#validation_errors</code> returns a <code>Hash</code>, keyed by attribute name, of any errors
    found on the instance. This allows you to report failures back to your users
    in a natural fashion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Validations are defined using the syntax <code>attribute_name_must</code> (for
    positive validations) or <code>attribute_name_must_not</code> (for negative ones).
  </p>

  <p>
    These validations are built using <em>predicates</em>, objects that represent abstract
    tests against values. The simplest predicate is a nil check, which matches
    values that are <code>nil</code>:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  verifiable

  attr_accessor :login
  login_must_not be_nil
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Multiple validations may be defined against an attribute and all will be tested:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  verifiable

  attr_accessor :login
  login_must_not be_nil
  login_must have_length(:at_least =&gt; 4)
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Predicates can take late-bound parameters, either positional or named:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  verifiable

  attr_accessor :login, :star_count
  login_must have_length, :at_least =&gt; 4
  star_count_must be_greater_than, 5
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Defining new predicates is as simple as defining a new class that inherits from
    <code>Verity::Predicates::Base</code> and a class method (available to your class) that
    constructs an appropriate instance of your class. Methods defined within
    <code>Verity::Predicates</code> are automatically available to all classes which define
    <code>verifiable</code>. As with RSpec, it is through judicious use of these methods that
    we gain our readability, so think carefully about how your definitions 'read'.
    In particular, be sparing with positional parameters (and treat them like
    direct and indirect objects in English) and use named parameters with keys that
    read like prepositional phrases (such as <code>with_domain</code> or <code>at_least</code>).
  </p>

<section id="sec-lazy-params">
  <header>
    <h2>Lazy parameters</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    Often we want to validate based on data only available at run-time, and often
    specific to the record being validated. Named predicate parameters in Verity
    support lazy evaluation using blocks. A block-valued parameter is evaluated at
    validation time to produce a value, which is then set on that predicate. The
    blocks may, optionally, take a parameter which is set to the record instance
    being validated. This may be used to retrieve attribute values at run-time.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Message
  verifiable

  attr_accessor :length, :message
  message_must have_length, :exactly =&gt; lambda{|r| r.length}
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    In fact, this usage is so important that we have a sugar defined for it using
    a method <code>the</code>:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Message
  verifiable

  attr_accessor :length, :message
  message_must have_length, :exactly =&gt; the(:length)
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It is planned to support this for positional parameters as well very shortly
    but this hasn't been implemented yet.
