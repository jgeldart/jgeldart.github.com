<p class="abstract" property="dcterms:description">
  Validations are important in many systems for maintaining data integrity with respect to some domain model.
  ActiveModel includes a set of validations which can be used in Rails for describing conditions on 
  model objects, but these are limited to persisted objects and lack expressiveness and reusability; slightly
  altering the nature of a validation often requires a new custom validation to be written. Verity provides
  a generic framework for validating any Ruby object, whether persisted or not, and composing validations
  with an expressive, readable DSL.

    <h2>Why do we validate?</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Validation is important for expressing domain constraints, ensuring that the data which is stored in an 
    information system makes sense. In a stock control system (for example) it would be nonsense for the 
    weight (or quantity) of a stock item to be negative. Validations allow us to prevent such data from being 
    persisted. Validations also allow us to check the sanity of the results of operations as a form of in 
    process error check. Any errors from these validations can be presented to the users, or put into a log, 
    in a readable form that explains exactly what went wrong and how to fix it. These improves the usability
    of the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good validation library makes it easy to express arbitrary aspects of the domain model. The complexity 
    of the code should be proportional to the complexity of the condition. A vital part of this is allowing 
    us to decompose complex conditions into small, reusable parts that may be glued back together in many 
    different ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/jgeldart/verity">Verity</a> is my attempt to provide an expressive validation system. Unlike <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/01/10/activemodel-make-any-ruby-object-feel-like-activerecord/">ActiveModel</a>, 
    the validations are expressed as a readable DSL. Unlike <a href="https://github.com/cainlevy/semantic-attributes">Semantic Attributes</a>, there is no tie to ActiveRecord.

    <h2>A humane validation library</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Verity’s aim is to make validations readable and composable and, therefore, more maintainable. After spending too 
    long writing complex, interdependent validations for a project with an (admittedly) tricky data model, I decided 
    that enough was enough. Validations are a vital part of the definition of a data model in any real-world 
    application, where data noise can be introduced by its users and code and must be prevented. As such, they should 
    be as nice to define as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Verity accomplishes this in two main ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It provides a DSL for defining the validations in a readable syntax similar to RSpec; and</li>
    <li>It treats validations lazily, so that they can be composed to construct more complex validations out of simpler ones.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The main inspirations for the project are <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> and <a href="http://github.com/cainlevy/semantic-attributes/">Semantic Attributes</a>, 
    a similar attempt to define a DSL for validations (although without the composability).
  </p>
  <p>
    As additional goals, Verity aims to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Be agnostic as to what persistence framework, if any, is being used; it is as useful on plain Ruby objects as it is on ActiveRecord records;</li>
    <li>Be easy to extend, with new predicates that can be shared with other developers and projects; and</li>
    <li>Integrate well with whatever internationalisation framework is being used to support multi-lingual and multi-region applications.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Possible future goals include integration with YARD, for easy documentation of model constraints, and RSpec and Cucumber, for testing these constraints.

    <h2>Using Verity</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Enabling Verity's DSL and core API on an object is simply a matter of using the
    class method <code>verifiable</code> in the class definition. This is an extension added
    to <code>Object</code> when the gem is loaded:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  verifiable
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Instances of this class now have a number of methods defined upon them for
    performing validations. <code>#valid?</code> returns <code>false</code> if and only if the
    instance fails to satisfy the defined conditions and <code>true</code> otherwise (note
    that it will return <code>true</code> if no validations are defined at all).
    <code>#validation_errors</code> returns a <code>Hash</code>, keyed by attribute name, of any errors
    found on the instance. This allows you to report failures back to your users
    in a natural fashion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Validations are defined using the syntax <code>attribute_name_must</code> (for
    positive validations) or <code>attribute_name_must_not</code> (for negative ones).
  </p>

  <p>
    These validations are built using <em>predicates</em>, objects that represent abstract
    tests against values. The simplest predicate is a nil check, which matches
    values that are <code>nil</code>:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  verifiable

  attr_accessor :login
  login_must_not be_nil
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Multiple validations may be defined against an attribute and all will be tested:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  verifiable

  attr_accessor :login
  login_must_not be_nil
  login_must have_length(:at_least =&gt; 4)
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Predicates can take late-bound parameters, either positional or named:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  verifiable

  attr_accessor :login, :star_count
  login_must have_length, :at_least =&gt; 4
  star_count_must be_greater_than, 5
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Defining new predicates is as simple as defining a new class that inherits from
    <code>Verity::Predicates::Base</code> and a class method (available to your class) that
    constructs an appropriate instance of your class. Methods defined within
    <code>Verity::Predicates</code> are automatically available to all classes which define
    <code>verifiable</code>. As with RSpec, it is through judicious use of these methods that
    we gain our readability, so think carefully about how your definitions 'read'.
    In particular, be sparing with positional parameters (and treat them like
    direct and indirect objects in English) and use named parameters with keys that
    read like prepositional phrases (such as <code>with_domain</code> or <code>at_least</code>).
  </p>
</section>
<section id="sec-lazy-params">
  <header>
    <h2>Lazy parameters</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    Often we want to validate based on data only available at run-time, and often
    specific to the record being validated. Named predicate parameters in Verity
    support lazy evaluation using blocks. A block-valued parameter is evaluated at
    validation time to produce a value, which is then set on that predicate. The
    blocks may, optionally, take a parameter which is set to the record instance
    being validated. This may be used to retrieve attribute values at run-time.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Message
  verifiable

  attr_accessor :length, :message
  message_must have_length, :exactly =&gt; lambda{|r| r.length}
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    In fact, this usage is so important that we have a sugar defined for it using
    a method <code>the</code>:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Message
  verifiable

  attr_accessor :length, :message
  message_must have_length, :exactly =&gt; the(:length)
end
</code></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It is planned to support this for positional parameters as well very shortly
    but this hasn't been implemented yet.

    <h2>Future work</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    This library is in a very early stage right now. There are lots of places it could go 
    depending on how I, and others, find use for it and the API is not settled yet. I have 
    considered a few of the possibilities, and have concrete plans for some.
  </p>
  <section id="subsec-activerecord">
    <header>
      <h3>ActiveRecord integration</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      Like it or not, ActiveRecord is a very important library that is used in many projects.
      Unfortunately, ActiveRecord’s validations (now provided through ActiveModel) are cumbersome
      and this was one of the main motivations for Verity. I plan to allow Verity to be used as 
      a drop-in replacement for ActiveModel’s validations. This will probably require some changes
      to the API to align the two. Ideally, I’d avoid an adapter library (such as many systems use)
      and a core dependency is out of the question; as mentioned previously, an aim of Verity is to 
      be usable with any Ruby object and definitely outside of Rails.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="subsec-internationalisation">
    <header>
      <h3>Internationalisation</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      The world is full of variety, and especially linguistic variety. Verity’s message system is
      very crude at the moment, and it is a priority that it supports multiple locales. This does not
      only include translation of messages, but also localised validations for things such as dates, 
      currencies, addresses and telephone numbers. Localisation and internationalisation should be 
      supported in some form no matter what system Verity is used in, although we could still leave
      the translations to the outer system.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="subsec-conditionals">
    <header>
      <h3>Conditional validation</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      Composability brings some exciting possibilities. One of these is allowing a boolean logic of 
      validations. A given validation can be said to apply (or not apply) only when another validation 
      passes. This could be used to avoid inundating the user with irrelevant messages or to define 
      complex domain constraints within a single model. As an example, imagine a validation on a
      message body that checks it doesn’t contain any links, but only if it is HTML:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Message
  verifiable
  body_must_not contain_selector("a"), :if =&gt; is_valid_html
end</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Implementing these conditionals may require some changes to the core DSL to make them expressive 
      yet humane.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="subsec-soft-validations">
    <header>
      <h3>Soft validations</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      We often deal with hard constraints, requiring that the user enter only perfect data. Sometimes,
      however, it can be useful to be more forgiving. I want to support soft validations that can be used 
      to present a warning to the user without blocking saving of the object. As an example, an email 
      should normally have a subject, but this is not required. Many email clients present a warning if you
      try to send an email without a subject. It would be useful to be able to express this warning in the 
      domain model:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Email
  verifiable
  subject_should_not be_nil
end</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The violation of a soft constraint could trigger a confirmation message, or simply display a note 
      remarking that a non-critical validation failed.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="subsec-quantifications">
    <header>
      <h3>Quantifications</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      Expressing constraints across collections can be difficult in non-composable systems. We often want
      to define the validity of some object in terms of the validity of some, or all, of the members of 
      a collection of associated objects. With a composable system, this becomes much easier:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="code">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Book
  verifiable
  chapters_must all, be_valid
  contact_emails_must some, be_verified
  reviewers_must none, be_banned
end</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The use of quantificational modifiers like <code>all</code>, <code>some</code> or <code>none</code> 
      allows us to apply validations to one-to-many associations without adding irrelevant validations to
      those model classes. In the above example, a user isn’t invalid if they are banned but they <em>are</em>
      an invalid member of the reviewers association for a book.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Verity provides an expressive, readable DSL for defining domain constraints on arbitrary Ruby objects. It
    does this by defining a composable framework of predicates, similar to RSpec, and combinators. A certain 
    amount of syntactic sugar is given to make it easy to not only use Verity to define validations, but also 
    to make writing new predicates as simple as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many exciting directions that this library could go in, and I look forward to getting feedback 
    from others. I have outlined some of my ideas above. Composability gives some great opportunities for 
    defining new syntax.
  </p>
  <p>
    This library is intended, above all else, to be useful. Currently its utility is limited by the paltry 
    number of predicates available. I hope to define, over time, a large library of predicates that will come
    out of the box. I also hope that others will build predicate libraries, and provide them to the community.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any questions, remarks or constructive criticism please leave a comment on this essay. Even if
    you don’t plan on using the library yourself, or contributing any code, any help with firming up the DSL and
    API would be appreciated.
